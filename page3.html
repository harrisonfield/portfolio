<h3> unit one outcome two </h3>
<h4>Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making
    your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code,
    Trello  </h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    I have used trello to plan my website and to make sure that i have included everything that I need to do. I have used visual studio code to code my website as it is one of the best coding software for making websites. 

</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code,
    Trello</h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    Visual studio code is an appropriate tool to use for coding websites because it is easy to use as when you complete your code the site automatically turns it into a new website. Trello has been useful because it allows me to plan what  am doing and make sure that I have done everything that I needed to do. I didn't use slack for this as it is a messaging tool and this is a solo activity so it would work better in group activities. 

</p>
<br><br>
<h4> Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with
    your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests
    of openness. What would you change? </h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    I am happy with my final website because it works and is easy to use. All of the information on my website is also easy to access so you don't have to search for a long time trying to find all of the information. I also think that the website looks good and presentable. If i had to change anything from my website I would like to make the website themed as all the colors look good together however i would like to give the website a theme and have all of the colors apply to that theme.

</p>
<br><br>
<h4>  Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    If I was going to improve my website I would like to make the website interactive so if you clicked on a certain bit of information then the website would take you to a larger amount of information that you could look through.

</p>
<br><br>
<h3> unit one outcome three </h3>
<br><br>
<h4>Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of
    productivity and efciency – could you have been more efcient when making your
    website? How? Could you have done it in teams?  </h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    The benefits of trello are that it is easy to use and that you can have multiple people on it. I can’t think of anything bad about trello. I think that visual studio coding has lots of benefits to other coding software as it is easy to use and creates the base of the website for you. The drawbacks of visual studio coding are that only one person can code so it’s hard for a group project.  
</p>
<br><br>
<h4> Describe ways to improve productivity and efciency  </h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    To improve productivity i could have given each paragraph a link that leads it to even more 
on the same subject. I could also have used more pages so that there is more room for each subject. If I was trying to improve the productivity of the website then I could have made this a team activity meaning that multiple people could be working on the website at one time, meaning that more work would have been done. It would also be a good idea to increase the amount of time spent on the project 
</p>
<br><br>
<h4>  Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what
    would you do diferently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    If I was working in a group then i could have used trello and slack to communicate with my team so that everyone would know what they were doing so that knowone does the same thing, increasing the amount of work that could be done.
</p>
<br><br>
<h4> Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    If I was testing for digital solutions I would visit the website and stress test it trying to break it to make sure that it works properly. If i was testing it i would also go over all of the code to make sure that it all works properly.  I would also use different coding software to test the code and make sure that it works.
