<h4>Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    IT is used in modern business to store the information for the company so that they can keep their ideas away from competitors helping their business stay ahead of all of the others. It also helps make things more accessible as if you need to find a document then anyone in the company can just search it up so you don't have to spend so much time looking for it.
</p>
<br><br>
<h4> Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    In order to make digital projects successfully a person will need the relevant skills and tools for the job. For this job that includes tools such as trello so that a person can keep a reliable checklist of what they have done, are doing and what they need to do. Trello is also good because you can share it with multiple people and you can make it where multiple people can edit the board. Another tool needed is slack as it allows you to talk to different people and share your code if you need help as most messaging services won't let you share code.There are also lots of other tools such as idle and the internet to help you if you are stuck and need some help. There are also lots of skills needed such as analytics and knowledge of the most used coding languages and how to use them. This will all add together to make a successful digital project.

<h4>Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h45>
<br><br>
<p>
    There are lots of risks when it comes to digital project such as poor planning as if one member of the team has a different plan than the other they could make it in different ways and the work may not fit with each other. Another risk could be that your team could have a bad organization area and some of the work that you have done could get lost meaning thay would have to waste time going it again.

<h4>Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    If I was selecting an IT system or software for a job I would do my research to see which is the best overall and which is the best for the specific purpose I need  and test them. I could also just test a bunch of systems to see which i liked the most and use that.

<h4>Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control 
</h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    I have used trello to help me plan my website as my group used i to help create our own text based RPG adventure game and it worked well. Trello is good for planning as it is very easy to use and you are able to share the page with your team so that you all can see what is done and what is left to do and the whole team is able to edit the page so they can check something off when they have finished it. 
</p>
<br><br>
<h4> Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?
</h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    GDPR stands for general data protection regulations meaning the regulations in the EU for data protection and privacy. This stops companies from stealing anything from one another and if a company is found stealing then there will be savir consequences.

<h4>Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h4>
<br><br>
<p>
    copyright will be used to protect my website and the content from other people when I post the website. This will stop people from copying my work and using it as their own. It also stops people from making adaptations of my work and stops people from renting or lending copies of my work.

<h4>Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them </h4>
